subtitle: How to lose you in a lot of unordered not so useful facts about myself

My name is Claire Bilat. I am a soon-to-be graduate student in Digital Forensics who has not a lot of time on her hands but still finds herself writing an `About me` section in her blog. I often initiate unexpected projects to try and sparkle my life, the latest of them being the start of my rock climbing and motorcycling hobbies (sorry mom). I love languages and start to learn a new one every other week on Duolingo (with more or less success). 

For more facts about me (that one could consider more relevant) related to my studies and career, please refer to my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clairebilat/), in which I also invested far more time than I would like to admit.
